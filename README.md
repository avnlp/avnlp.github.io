## LLM Blender
LLM-Blender is a two-stage ensemble learning framework. In the first stage (ranking), pairwise comparison of candidates is performed, and they are then ranked. In the second stage (fusing), the top K candidates are merged to render the final output.
LLM-Blender is an ensembling framework designed to achieve consistently superior performance by combining the outputs of multiple language models (LLMs). This work focuses on integrating LLM-Blender with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines to significantly improve the quality of generated text.

## RRF
In the intricate world of Long-form Question Answering (LFQA) and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), making the most of the LLM’s context window is paramount. Any wasted space or repetitive content limits the depth and breadth of the answers we can extract and generate. It’s a delicate balancing act to lay out the content of the context window appropriately.

With the addition of three rankers, viz., Diversity Ranker, Lost In The Middle Ranker, Similarity Rankers and RRF techniques, we aim to address these challenges and improve the answers generated by the LFQA/RAG pipelines. We have done a comparative study of adding different combinations of rankers in a Retrieval pipeline and evaluated the results on four metrics, viz., Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG), Mean Average Precision (MAP), Recall and Precision.
